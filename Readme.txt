If you plan to use any of the code i publish in this repository, please note that I am running a 4.4 Kernel and Debian 9.2 on my Beaglebone.
If you have e.g. a 3.8 kernel installed, the system directories I am using will not be compatible.
The location of the bone cape manager on 4.4 Kernel can be found at /sys/devices/platform.
